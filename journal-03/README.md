## Journal 3 - Instagram Defects

**Jozzel Esqueda 05/9/2020**

Instagram was cool before it added stories and removed the feature where
you can check other people's activity.


While watching a person's instagram story, as soon as their story ends it
automatically plays the next persons ig story. This feautre is **ineffecient**
because if I am watching a certain person's story, it doesn't neccessarily mean
I want to watch the next person's story. 

One should have the option to watch the next person's story.

Before instagram added the stories feature, it had another feature where you 
can see other people's activity. With this feature you were able to see what
photos the people you're following liked or commented on, who they started 
followng and at what times they were doing this.

It was **learnable** and **error tolerant**. 
For the couples in a rocky relationship, you were able to find out what 
pictures your significant other was liking/commenting on, whether they 
were ignoring your text messages yet active on ig, and verify this all on
instagram by sliding your finger on the notification tab.
