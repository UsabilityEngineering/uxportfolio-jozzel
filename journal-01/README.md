## Journal 1 - Is It Good Enough ?

  As I navigate through the Google Translate App, I am **satisfied** by the set up on the user interface because it looks really similar to when I google, for example, "translation from english to spanish".

  I simply click on the "Enter Text" section and type in anything I want to get trnaslated regardless of the lanuage. Afterwards I click on the top boxes that lie in between the two arrows and choose the two languages that I need to get translated. Then I press the blue arrow and a blue blox appears underneathe with the translated phrase:

  The only flaw that I can think of is that audio detection could get better by being able to detect fast speaking audio because sometimes a person speaking in their native tongue sometimes speak faster than normal. Overall, the app was very **useful**.
